I have successfully implemented a comprehensive set of tasks encompassing user authentication and data management using various technologies. Specifically, I have developed functionalities for user sign-up, login, and data retrieval from a MongoDB database using Node.js and Express.js. Additionally, I have implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a ToDo application using SQLite as the database management system.

These tasks involved:

1. **User Authentication (Sign Up & Login)**: Utilizing MongoDB as the database backend, I implemented secure sign-up and login functionalities to allow users to create accounts and authenticate themselves securely. Node.js and Express.js were leveraged to build the server-side logic for handling user authentication requests.

2. **Data Retrieval from MongoDB**: With the MongoDB database, I created endpoints in the Node.js server to facilitate the retrieval of user data from the database. This involved querying the MongoDB database to fetch user information based on specified criteria, such as email or user ID.

3. **ToDo CRUD Operations with SQLite**: I developed a ToDo application that performs CRUD operations using SQLite as the underlying database. This involved creating tables to store ToDo items, implementing logic to add, retrieve, update, and delete ToDo entries, and exposing endpoints in the Node.js server to handle these operations.

Overall, these tasks allowed me to gain practical experience in building robust and scalable web applications, handling user authentication securely, and performing database operations efficiently using both MongoDB and SQLite.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
